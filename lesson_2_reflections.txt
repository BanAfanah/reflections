What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It saves a repository on the git for the directory preparing it to 
have all next versions and be used for other features. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
It is like an intermediate level between the two things. The working directory
has all files related to a project whether they are desired to be on git
or not. On the other hand, the repository has only the files that are already
on git and now ready for version control. The staging area has the files that
are intended to be on git but not there yet and have the possibility of 
completing their way to git or stay without version control.  

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
